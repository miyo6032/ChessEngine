# Python Chess Engine
This is a python chess engine built on a python chess library called [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/v0.23.10/core.html).

It uses the following algorithms to work: negamax, alpha-beta pruning, quiescence search, iterative deepening.

To run, just use the command 'python ChessEngine.py', and the agent will play against the [Stockfish Engine](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish), which is locally stored on this repository.
